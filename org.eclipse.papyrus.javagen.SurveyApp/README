 Information for grading:
 
 Source files are located in "src/io/billanderson/surveyapp", according to
 package naming and directory structure conventions. 
 
 The method chosen for saving and loading files is binary serialization, as
 the implementation was straightforward, and achieved the desired results.
 No significant issues are present in this implementation at this time.
 
 One sample each has been
 included in the directory "userFiles/" for both Survey and Test files. They
 are named "sample.survey" and "sample.test", respectively. Their contents are
 contrived questions with little actual meaning, but demonstrate the
 functionality of the program well enough.
 
 In order to load saved files, select either 5) or 6) to load a Survey or Test,
 respectively. The user may then use 3) or 4) to display the Survey or Test,
 respectively.
 
 Feel free to create your own surveys and tests. The operation should be self-
 explanatory and the program robust against invalid input and user error.
